/**
 * Five-star rating, whole or half stars.
 *
 * ── STEP IS OPT-IN, AND THAT IS THE TRUNCATION GUARD ────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `step` defaults to 1. Half stars exist only where a caller passes `step={0.5}` — the reader's own
 * rating (`books.rating`, `reads.rating`, both `numeric(2,1)`). The REVIEWS composer never passes
 * it, because `reviews.rating` is a cross-user `smallint`: a 4.5 sent there would silently
 * truncate. `useUpsertReview` additionally refuses non-integers loudly (see data/reviews.ts) —
 * the default here is the first fence, that throw is the one that cannot be forgotten at a new
 * call site.
 *
 * ── THE INTERACTIVE PATH IS A SLIDER, NOT A BUTTON ROW — the a11y is the feature ────────────────
 * Half steps have to be reachable without a pointer, and a screen reader has to say "3.5 stars",
 * not five booleans. That is the WAI-ARIA rating pattern: one `role="slider"` stop with
 * Left/Right = ±step, Home/End = 0/5, `aria-valuetext` carrying the human value. A button-per-star
 * group cannot express 3.5 without ten buttons or a hidden click-cycles-through-states affordance;
 * the slider gets keyboard, announcement, and touch for free. Pointer clicks still work per star:
 * the LEFT HALF of a star sets the half value when step=0.5, the right half the whole — and
 * clicking the current value clears to 0, the affordance the whole-star control already had.
 *
 * Rendering: each star is a chip-border glyph with a gold overlay clipped to 0/50/100% width —
 * same two colours the whole-star control used, so no new contrast pair is introduced.

  // (one place, #289); its isFinite guard is the one delta from the expression it replaces —

  // widths. Unreachable from a numeric column; strictly safer where it isn't.

   * the keyboard's `set(shown + delta)`, and the clicking-your-current-value-clears check. `display`
   * is the render-only value, and only `fill()` reads it.
   *
   * Collapsing the two — letting hover override `shown` outright — breaks three things quietly:
   *   · aria would announce a value the reader never chose. A screen-reader user is not moving a
   *     mouse, so a hover preview is a sighted-mouse-user affordance; the accessible value must not
   *     appear to change until a real commit. This is deliberately NOT what is on screen mid-hover.
   *   · arrow keys would step from wherever the mouse happens to be resting rather than from the
   *     committed rating.
   *   · clear-on-reclick compares the clicked value to the current one; against a hover value that
   *     comparison is `v === v` and the affordance dies.

  /**
   * TOUCH TARGET SIZING — coarse pointers only, interactive only.
   *
   * Measured before (390x844): the glyph box was 19.88 x 20px, so each HALF-star zone was
   * 9.94 x 20 — 41% of WCAG 2.5.8's 24x24 minimum (AA in 2.2). Greg reported half stars as hard
   * to hit; that number is the report.
   *
   * A half-zone is BY CONSTRUCTION half a star's box and the zones tile a continuous strip, so
   * padding buys nothing — every pixel already belongs to some half. The star BOX WIDTH is the
   * only lever, and the arithmetic is forced:
   *   step 0.5 -> 10 targets -> 10 x 24 = 240px strip  (62% of a 390px viewport — fits)
   *   step 1   ->  5 targets ->  5 x 24 = 120px strip  (the reviews composer, which omits `step`)
   * 2.5.5 (AAA, 44px) is NOT chased: 10 x 44 = 440px does not fit 390.
   *
   * GLYPH AND ZONE ARE SEPARATE, deliberately: the zone width is driven by the floor above, the
   * glyph stays at its designed `size` (20px default) and is centred inside it. Growing the star
   * to 48px to win the target would be a design change nobody asked for.
   *
   * DISPLAY-MODE STARS ARE NOT TARGETS and get none of this — no floor applies to them.
   *
   * Scope is `pointer-coarse:` (Tailwind's variant, the idiom CoverCard's fave toggle already
   * uses, alongside globals.css's coarse-pointer font-size rule). It cannot affect desktop, and
   * it cannot affect the surface-visual harness, which runs Desktop Chrome — a FINE pointer.

  /**
   * GLYPH SIZE ON COARSE POINTERS — ruled from the crops, not defaulted.
   *
   * The zone work above widened the interactive strip 107px -> 240px while the glyph stayed at its
   * designed 20px, leaving ~28px of empty space per cell. The before/after crops (almanac + tryst,
   * 390x844) showed two things a passing geometry assertion cannot: the row stopped reading as ONE
   * control and became five scattered marks, and — worse — the SAME screen carries display-mode
   * stars (the per-format line, per-read rows) whose tight rhythm the spread row now contradicts.
   * Same glyph size, radically different spacing, 40px apart vertically: that reads as broken
   * rather than as hierarchy.
   *
   * 32px in a 48px cell fills it, restores the row as a unit, and makes the interactive control
   * visibly PRIMARY against the small (12px) display rows — which is the correct relationship and
   * turns the mismatch into hierarchy. 20px was designed for a fine pointer at desktop scale; a
   * thumb at 390px is a different design context. Targets comply at either glyph size, so this is
   * a design call — and the crops are why it is now a decision rather than a leftover.
   *
   * Delivered as a CSS variable so the coarse-pointer override beats the inline base size, and so
   * DISPLAY-MODE stars keep their caller's `size` untouched (they are not targets and get none of
   * this).

  //  so the class was present, the CSS was generated, and the glyph still computed 20px. Measured,
  //  not reasoned — the audit read `--star-glyph: 20px` with the class applied.
