// WHAT A SWEEP IS ALLOWED TO CALL "CHECKED".
//
// `enriched_at` is a negative cache: stamping it rests the book for 3 days (30 if it came out
// complete). So the stamp is a claim that the sources were actually asked and actually answered.
//
// Three production sweeps stopped early and each reported the shape of a finished run, because
// every failure mode collapsed into `{ status: 'empty' }` — the same value the sources return when
// they genuinely have nothing. A 4xx whose body was HTML threw inside the parser, the thrown
// SyntaxError carried no status, and the book was stamped as checked on the strength of an outage.
//
// These tests pin the three things that must stay distinct: a miss is stamped, a refusal is not,
// and a failure is not — and a run that hits failures cannot report itself as clean.
