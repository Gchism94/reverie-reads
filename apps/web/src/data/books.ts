/** Optimistic update: patch the cache immediately, roll back on error, reconcile on settle. */
/**
 * Patch one book.
 *
 * `scopeBookId` SERIALIZES successive writes to that book, and exists because unserialized ones
 * corrupt data rather than merely arriving out of order. Every patch here is a whole-field write —
 * `{ plan }` sends all three plan columns, `{ owned }` sends all three format flags — so if two
 * in-flight writes for the same book land in the wrong order, the earlier, less complete one wins
 * and silently overwrites the later one. That is not hypothetical: `PlanEditor` produced exactly
 * this, and a reader tabbing Year → Month → Day could lose their month and day (#116, caught by the
 * plan-precision e2e at position 27 of 80 — load-sensitive, which is why it passed the run before).
 *
 * Scope lives on the mutation's OPTIONS, not on the variables — verified against query-core 5.101's
 * `scopeFor`/`canRun`, which read `mutation.options.scope.id` and let a scoped mutation start only
 * when no other mutation sharing that id is pending. So it cannot be derived per `mutate()` call
 * from the book id; the caller has to declare it, which is why this is a parameter rather than
 * something the hook works out for itself.
 *
 * Deliberately OPT-IN. A blanket scope would serialize genuinely independent writes: `moveReading`
 * (HomeRoute) renumbers N books in one gesture, one write each, and those must stay parallel. Pass
 * the id from any component that writes ONE book repeatedly; leave it off for fan-out across books.
 * Bulk import is unaffected either way — it never uses this hook, writing through
 * `supabase.from('books').update()` directly (`intake.ts`, `importExport.ts`).
