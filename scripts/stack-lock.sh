# stack-lock.sh — serialise every command that touches the local Supabase stack.
#
# Runs <command...> holding an exclusive, machine-global lock, and propagates its exit code
# unchanged. One acquisition covers the WHOLE stack-touching span — start / reset / seed / the
# entire e2e run — because guarding individual commands leaves exactly the window this exists to
# close.
#
# ── The class it ends ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Five collisions in two days, five different mechanisms, one shape: CHECK-THEN-ACT on a shared
# local stack. A session checks the stack looks free, then acts, and a second session interleaves
# between the two. Fixing the mechanisms one at a time produced five fixes and five recurrences:
#
#   1. a runner printed CONTENDED and ran anyway — the gate and the act were separated in time
#   2. a pre-flight port check treated as sufficient when the stack operations happened later
#   3. a `db reset` deadlocked mid-run, disrupting both sides
#   4. the seeded dev account vanished mid-assessment, the DB filling with another run's spec
#      users — during an ANNOUNCED hold
#   5. the dev seed vanished again during #307, costing a re-seed and a re-capture
#
# An advisory-lock syscall has no window between checking and holding, which is why this ends the
# class rather than narrowing it again. Announcing, port-probing and politeness are all check-then-
# act; `lockf`/`flock` is not.
#
# ── Why serialise rather than isolate ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Per-worktree stacks were costed and are dead on resources: three stacks already run on this box
# (34 containers, ~5.7 GB of 16 GB, load 12.72/18.18/20.05 on 8 cores). Concurrency here was never
# REQUIRED, only ever wanted — so serialising costs wall-clock and nothing else. The asymmetry is
# the argument: a collision costs a full e2e re-run (measured 14.4–18.2 min) and usually costs it to
# BOTH sides, while waiting costs at most the holder's remainder.
#
# ── The fd is the truth; the sidecar is decoration ──────────────────────────────────────────────
# The kernel releases the lock fd when the holder dies, so a `kill -9`'d holder leaves nothing to
# clean up and there is no stale-lock ritual. The sidecar file below records pid/command/start-time
# ONLY to make the waiting message useful. It is never read to decide whether the lock is free —
# doing that would reintroduce check-then-act one level up, inside the code whose whole purpose is
# to remove it.
#
# ── Formerly a known gap, now closed — two real incidents, not luck ────────────────────────────
# `npx playwright test` / `supabase db reset` invoked DIRECTLY used to bypass this lock silently;
# this file used to call that out of scope by choice. Two real collisions changed that call: a
# parallel session's raw `npx playwright test` collided with another session's e2e run on the
# fixed port 4317 (17x ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED), and a `db:reset` overlapped a live session by
# ordering luck, not because this lock enforced anything. Both raw forms are now refused two ways:
#   - `.claude/hooks/pretooluse-guard.sh` blocks them at the Bash-tool layer for Claude Code
#     sessions, before either binary even starts (see its own header for exactly what it matches).
#   - apps/web/playwright.config.ts additionally refuses to load unless RV_STACK_LOCK_HELD=1 (the
#     flag this script sets, below) or CI is set — that one fires for ANY `playwright test`
#     invocation, human terminals included, not only Claude Code's.
# `supabase db reset` has no equivalent config-load hook (the CLI is a compiled binary with no
# script-loading point to hang a check on), so the Bash-tool hook is its only mechanical gate;
# a human typing it directly in a terminal still relies on this comment and CLAUDE.md.
#
# Testability: the lock binary is `${STACK_LOCK_BIN:-auto}` and the lock path
# `${RV_STACK_LOCK_FILE:-derived}`, so scripts/stack-lock.test.sh drives every branch without
# touching the real stack.
#
# Escapes, both deliberate and typed rather than defaulted:
#   RV_STACK_LOCK_DISABLE=1   run unguarded (the no-binary refusal names this)
#   RV_STACK_LOCK_TIMEOUT=N   seconds to wait before failing (default 2700 = 45 min)

# ── Re-entrancy ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# `lockf`/`flock` are NOT reentrant: a nested acquisition of the same file self-deadlocks. Nothing
# in the tree nests through this wrapper TODAY — a11y.spec.ts and shelf-membership.spec.ts do shell
# out mid-run, but to `node scripts/seed-dev.mjs` directly rather than through `pnpm db:seed`. That
# is one refactor away from bricking every a11y run, so the escape is insurance, not ceremony.

# ── Every non-locking path announces itself, on stderr ─────────────────────────────────────────
# There are three ways this script does NOT lock: re-entrancy, CI, and the explicit disable. Each
# prints one line naming WHICH path and WHY, and all three go to stderr — two of them printed to
# stdout in the first draft, where a notice is easily lost in command output and pollutes anything
# parsing it. A guard built to end a SILENT failure must not fail silently itself.
#
# The gate below stays `CI` rather than the narrower `GITHUB_ACTIONS`: `CI` is what every runner
# sets and keeps this correct if CI ever moves, and the risk it carries — some local tool exporting
# CI=1 and silently unlocking a developer run — is answered by VISIBILITY rather than by narrowing.
# The line prints the value it saw (`CI=1`), so a wrongly-set gate announces itself on every run
# instead of quietly dropping the lock.
#
# ── CI passthrough, and why it is correct rather than a dodge ──────────────────────────────────
# This lock serialises SESSIONS SHARING ONE DEVELOPER BOX. On CI each job gets a dedicated ephemeral
# runner with its own stack, so there is no shared resource and nothing to serialise. Locking there
# would be overhead that can only ever fail (a missing binary) for zero benefit. CI's e2e jobs call
# `pnpm --filter @reverie/web e2e --project=…`, which routes through the wrapped script — this is
# the branch that keeps that harmless. (Checked, not assumed: `flock` IS present on ubuntu-latest —
# util-linux 2.39.3 — so this is a correctness choice, not a workaround for an absent binary.)
