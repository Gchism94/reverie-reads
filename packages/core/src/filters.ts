/** How many books the CURRENT SEARCH matched but the default-library scope withheld.

 *  SAY WHAT YOU SILENTLY DID. matchesFilters applies the inDefaultLibrary gate BEFORE the text
 *  filter, which is deliberate — but it means an exact-title query on a wishlist-only book returns
 *  an empty grid with no indication anything was held back. The strongest intent signal a reader
 *  can send is overruled by a view default, silently. This counts what was withheld so the UI can
 *  state it. The sibling case is DuplicateReview's `differs` line, which narrates the values a
 *  merge silently keeps over the ones it discards; Discover's fn-down fallback is the third surface
 *  with the same shape (curated content substituted for live, indistinguishably) and has no such
 *  line yet. All three do a defensible thing quietly; the fix is never to stop doing it, it is to
 *  say so.
 *
 *  Both operands go through matchesFilters itself rather than re-deriving the predicate, so the
 *  count can never disagree with the grid it annotates: a book counts only if lifting the scope
 *  gate — and nothing else — would have brought it in. Every other facet still applies, so a book
 *  the genre chip excluded is not reported as withheld by scope.
 *
 *  Zero without a query, mirroring matchesFilters' own `if (f.q)` gate: this narrates SEARCH, and
 *  the unqueried grid already reads as "your library", not as a result set. Naturally zero when the
 *  wishlist chip is already on or a shelf link is active, since neither run the gate — both
 *  operands then agree, and there is nothing left to reveal. Like the differs line, it must return
 *  nothing when nothing was withheld: a standing "0 hidden" is what teaches a reader to stop
